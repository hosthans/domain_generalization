This section provides a concise reference describing notation as used in the book by \citet{goodfellow2016deep}.
If you are unfamiliar with any of the corresponding mathematical concepts,
\citet{goodfellow2016deep} describe most of these ideas in
chapters 2--4. \\[0.7cm]

% Need to use minipage to keep title of table on same page as table
% This is a hack to put a little title over the table
% We cannot use "\section*", etc., they appear in the table of contents.
% tocdepth does not work on this chapter.

\bgroup
% The \arraystretch definition here increases the space between rows in the table,
% so that \displaystyle math has more vertical space.

\begin{tabular}{cp{3.25in}}
$\displaystyle a$ & A scalar (integer or real)\\
$\displaystyle \va$ & A vector\\
$\displaystyle \mA$ & A matrix\\
$\displaystyle \tA$ & A tensor\\
$\displaystyle \mI_n$ & Identity matrix with $n$ rows and $n$ columns\\
$\displaystyle \mI$ & Identity matrix with dimensionality implied by context\\
$\displaystyle \ve^{(i)}$ & Standard basis vector $[0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0]$ with a 1 at position $i$\\
$\displaystyle \text{diag}(\va)$ & A square, diagonal matrix with diagonal entries given by $\va$\\
$\displaystyle \ra$ & A scalar random variable\\
$\displaystyle \rva$ & A vector-valued random variable\\
$\displaystyle \rmA$ & A matrix-valued random variable\\
